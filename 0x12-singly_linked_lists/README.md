# Singly Linked List in C

## Introduction

This project explores the implementation of a singly linked list in C. A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, each containing data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. Singly linked lists are commonly used to implement dynamic data structures that can be easily modified and traversed.

## List of Programs

This repository contains the following programs:

1. `0-print_list.c` - A program that defines a function to print all the elements of a singly linked list.
2. `1-list_len.c` - A program that defines a function to count the number of elements in a singly linked list.
3. `2-add_node.c` - A program that defines a function to add a new node at the beginning of a singly linked list.
4. `3-add_node_end.c` - A program that defines a function to add a new node at the end of a singly linked list.
5. `4-free_list.c` - A program that defines a function to free the memory allocated to a singly linked list.

## Compilation and Execution

Each program can be compiled using the following command:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <program_name.c> -o <output_file_name>
```


For example, to compile the `0-print_list.c` program, you can run:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 0-print_list.c -o print_list
```


To execute the compiled program, simply run:

```
./<output_file_name>
```


## Conclusion

I hope this project has helped you understand how singly linked lists work and how they can be implemented in C. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to leave a comment or contact me directly. Thank you for reading!
