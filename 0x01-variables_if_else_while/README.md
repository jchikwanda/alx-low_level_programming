## About This Directory
It contains my solutions to the problem statements below.

### [Question 1 Solution]()
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

1. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c)
2. The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
3. You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
4. The output of the program should be:
    - The number, followed by
        - if the number is greater than 0: is positive
        - if the number is 0: is zero
        - if the number is less than 0: is negative
    - followed by a new line

### [Question 2 Solution]()

This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

1. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/1-last_digit_c)
2. The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program
3. You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, and RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
4. The output of the program should be:
    - The string Last digit of, followed by
    - n, followed by
    - the string is, followed by
        - if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
        - if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
        - if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
    - followed by a new line
